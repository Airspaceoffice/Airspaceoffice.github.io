                changes to these Terms.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>Any part, provision, representation or warranty of this Agreement which is prohibited or which is held
                to be void or unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability
                without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof. Any part, provision, representation or warranty
                of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable or is held to be void or unenforceable in any
                jurisdiction shall be ineffective, as to such jurisdiction, to the extent of such prohibition or
                unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
                unenforceability in any jurisdiction as to any Mortgage Loan shall not invalidate or render
                unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the
                parties hereto waive any provision of law which prohibits or renders void or unenforceable any
                provision hereof. If the invalidity of any part, provision, representation or warranty of this
                Agreement shall deprive any party of the economic benefit intended to be conferred by this Agreement,
                the parties shall negotiate, in good-faith, to develop a structure the economic effect of which is
                nearly as possible the same as the economic effect of this Agreement without regard to such invalidity.
