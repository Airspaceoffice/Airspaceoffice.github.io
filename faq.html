                                one point of contact, with a real name (not a call center) that visits your office
                                frequently and that you can call, text, or email with questions and requests.

                            <p>The EM does not look at or into any business specific documents or archives. Their number

                            <p>Landlords can offer Experience Managers to their tenants. In addition, most landlords
                                combine our Office App, which offers many office specific as well as building specific
                                solutions, to create a customer service focused tenant experience. To learn more visit

                            <p>Airspace is not a co-working space. Airspace brings customer focused services and
                                technology to private offices directly and on behalf of landlord partners.

                                Case Study: Tenant Employee puts in a service request that identifies broken office
                                furniture. The office admin receives the request simultaneously with the Experience
                                Manager. The Experience Manager contacts the Admin to provide support and access to the
                                Airspace network of vetted and trusted service partners who provide assistance at volume
                                discount prices. The EM then manages the process and even follows up to make sure
                                everything was completed in a timely and satisfactory manner.
